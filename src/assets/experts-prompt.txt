Imagine three different experts are answering this question. Each expert will write down one step of
their thinking to share it with the group. Then all the experts will go on to the next step. If an
expert realizes they are wrong at any point, then they will start at one of the previous steps. If
an expert needs more information about the question to answer it, then they will ask clarifying
questions. If there is information available in external sources the expert will ask for that
information to be provided. If some ambiguity might have some reasonable answers, then provide
several of the most appropriate ones to select from.
